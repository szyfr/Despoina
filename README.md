### About
Designed to be an "emulator" for an 8-bit retro game handheld/console that never existed for the purpose of making fun games using assembly in a way that isn't mind-numbingly horrible like x86.

The project is still in its *very* early stages, but as it gets more and more complete there will be more documentation on how everything works.
